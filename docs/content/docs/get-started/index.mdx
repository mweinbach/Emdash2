description: Get started with Emdash2
---

Emdash2 lets you run multiple coding agents in parallel—each isolated in its own Git worktree. It's provider-agnostic (supporting 15+ CLI providers like Claude Code, Codex, and GitHub Copilot), local-first, and designed for testing multiple approaches to the same problem or tackling multiple features simultaneously.

Pass tickets directly from Linear, Jira, or GitHub Issues, review diffs side-by-side, and when the environment matters, run agents in isolated Docker containers. Everything stays on your machine—no code leaves your local environment except through the CLI providers you choose to use.
