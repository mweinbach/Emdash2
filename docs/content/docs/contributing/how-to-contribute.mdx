description: Help improve Emdash - contribution guidelines and development setup
---

Thanks for your interest in contributing! We favor small, focused PRs and clear intent over big bangs. This guide explains how to get set up, the workflow we use, and a few project‑specific conventions.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 20.0.0+ (recommended: 22.20.0)**, **Bun 1.3+**, and Git
- Optional (recommended for end‑to‑end):
  - Codex CLI (`npm install -g @openai/codex` or `brew install codex`; then run `codex` to authenticate)
  - GitHub CLI (`brew install gh`; then `gh auth login`)

### Setup

```bash
# Fork this repo, then clone your fork (Emdash2)
git clone https://github.com/<you>/Emdash2.git
cd Emdash2

# Use the correct Node.js version (if using nvm)
nvm use

# Quick start: install dependencies and run dev server
bun run d

# Or run separately:
bun install
bun run dev

# Type checking, lint, build
bun run type-check
bun run lint
bun run build
```

**Tip:** During development, the renderer hot‑reloads. Changes to the Tauri core (files in `src-tauri/src`) require a restart of the dev app.

## Project Overview

- `src-tauri/src/` – Tauri commands, IPC handlers, services (Git, worktrees, DB, etc.)
- `src/renderer/` – React UI (Vite), hooks, components
- Local database – SQLite file created under the OS userData folder (see "Local DB" below)
- Worktrees – Git worktrees are created outside your repo root in a sibling `worktrees/` folder
- Logs – Agent stream logs are written to the OS userData folder (not inside repos)

## Development Workflow

### 1. Create a feature branch

```bash
git checkout -b feat/<short-slug>
```

### 2. Make changes and keep PRs small and focused

- Prefer a series of small PRs over one large one.
- Include UI screenshots/GIFs when modifying the interface.
- Update docs (README or inline help) when behavior changes.

### 3. Run checks locally

```bash
bun run type-check
bun run lint
bun run build
```

### 4. Commit using Conventional Commits

- `feat:` – new user‑facing capability
- `fix:` – bug fix
- `chore:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`, `perf:`, `test:` etc.

**Examples:**

```
fix(chat): preserve stream state across workspace switches

feat(ci): add type-check + build workflow for PRs
```

### 5. Open a Pull Request

- Describe the change, rationale, and testing steps.
- Link related Issues.
- Keep the PR title in Conventional Commit format if possible.

## Code Style and Patterns

### TypeScript + ESLint

- Keep code type‑safe. Run `bun run type-check` before pushing.
- Run `bun run lint` and address warnings where reasonable.

### Tauri core (Rust side)

- Prefer `std::process::Command` with explicit args to avoid shell quoting issues.
- Never write logs into Git worktrees. Stream logs belong in the app data directory.
- Be conservative with logging; noisy logs reduce signal. Use clear prefixes.

### Git and worktrees

- The app creates worktrees in a sibling `../worktrees/` folder.
- Do not delete worktree folders from Finder/Explorer; if you need cleanup, use:
  - `git worktree prune` (from the main repo)
  - or the in‑app workspace removal
- The file `codex-stream.log` is intentionally excluded from Git status and auto‑ignored in new worktrees.

### Renderer (React)

- Components live under `src/renderer/components`; hooks under `src/renderer/hooks`.
- Streaming UI conventions:
  - "Reasoning" content renders inside a collapsible.
  - Response content is shown only after a `codex` marker.
  - While waiting for the first marker, show the minimal "loading/working" indicator.
- Use existing UI primitives and Tailwind utility classes for consistency.
- Aim for accessible elements (labels, `aria-*` where appropriate).

### Local DB (SQLite)

**Location** (Tauri app data dir):

- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/emdash/emdash.db`
- Linux: `~/.local/share/emdash/emdash.db`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\\emdash\\emdash.db`

**Reset:** quit the app, delete the file, relaunch (the schema is recreated).

## Issue Reports and Feature Requests

Use GitHub Issues. Include:

- OS, Node version
- Steps to reproduce
- Relevant logs (renderer console, terminal output)
- Screenshots/GIFs for UI issues

## Release Process (maintainers)

Use Bun's built-in versioning to ensure consistency:

```bash
# For bug fixes (0.2.9 → 0.2.10)
bun pm version patch

# For new features (0.2.9 → 0.3.0)
bun pm version minor

# For breaking changes (0.2.9 → 1.0.0)
bun pm version major
```

This automatically:

1. Updates `package.json` and `bun.lock` (or `bun.lockb`) when present
2. Creates a git commit with the version number (e.g., `"0.2.10"`)
3. Creates a git tag (e.g., `v0.2.10`)

Then push to trigger the CI/CD pipeline.

### What happens next

The GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) automatically:

1. **Triggers** when it detects the `v*` tag
2. **Builds** the TypeScript and Vite bundles
3. **Signs** the app with Apple Developer ID
4. **Notarizes** via Apple's notary service
5. **Creates** a GitHub Release with the DMG artifacts
6. **Uploads** signed DMGs for both arm64 and x64 architectures
