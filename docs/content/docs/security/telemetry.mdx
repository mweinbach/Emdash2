description: What data Emdash collects, what it doesn't, and how to opt out
---

Emdash2 respects your privacy. This page explains our telemetry practices in detail.

## Overview

- Emdash2 collects **anonymous usage telemetry** to improve the app
- Telemetry is **enabled by default** but can be easily disabled
- Data is sent to PostHog using **explicit, allowlisted events only**
- **No autocapture or session recording** is enabled in the app

## How to Opt Out

### In-App Settings

1. Open Emdash2 Settings
2. Navigate to **General → Privacy & Telemetry**
3. Toggle telemetry **off**

### Environment Variable

Set the environment variable before launching the app:

```bash
TELEMETRY_ENABLED=false
```

This completely disables telemetry at the application level.

## What We Collect

We only collect **anonymous, aggregated usage data** to understand how Emdash is used and improve the product.

### Events Tracked

#### App Lifecycle Events

**`app_started`** (automatically on app launch)

- `app_version` - Emdash2 version number
- `runtime_version` - Tauri runtime version
- `platform` - Operating system (macOS, Windows, Linux)
- `arch` - CPU architecture (x64, arm64)
- `is_dev` - Whether running in development mode
- `install_source` - Distribution channel (dmg, dev, etc.)

**`app_closed`** (automatically on app quit)

- Same properties as `app_started`

**`app_session`** (on quit; duration only)

- `session_duration_ms` - How long the app was open

#### Feature Usage Events

We track **anonymous feature usage** to understand which parts of Emdash2 are most valuable:

- **Project management**: Creating, opening, deleting projects
- **Workspace (task) management**: Creating, deleting, switching providers
- **Terminal usage**: Opening terminal, executing commands
- **File changes**: Viewing diffs, creating pull requests
- **Plan mode**: Enabling/disabling plan mode
- **Settings & preferences**: Theme changes, notification settings, default provider
- **Integrations**: Linear and Jira connections and searches
- **Container connections**: Docker dev environment setup
- **UI interactions**: Toolbar buttons, sidebar toggles, Kanban view

All events include only:

- Event name (e.g., `project_created`, `terminal_opened`)
- Safe, anonymized properties (e.g., `provider: "claude"`, `state: "open"`)
- No file paths, code, prompts, or identifying information

**App Lifecycle**: `app_started`, `app_closed`, `app_window_focused`, `app_session`

**GitHub Integration**: `github_connection_triggered`, `github_connected`

**Project Management**: `project_add_clicked`, `project_open_clicked`, `project_added_success`, `project_deleted`, `project_view_opened`

**Workspace (Task) Management**: `workspace_created`, `workspace_deleted`, `workspace_provider_switched`, `workspace_custom_named`, `workspace_advanced_options_opened`

**Terminal**: `terminal_entered`, `terminal_command_executed`, `terminal_new_terminal_created`, `terminal_deleted`

**Changes & PRs**: `changes_viewed`, `pr_created`, `pr_creation_failed`, `pr_viewed`

**Plan Mode**: `plan_mode_enabled`, `plan_mode_disabled`

**Linear Integration**: `linear_connected`, `linear_disconnected`, `linear_issues_searched`, `linear_issue_selected`

**Jira Integration**: `jira_connected`, `jira_disconnected`, `jira_issues_searched`, `jira_issue_selected`

**Container & Dev Environment**: `container_connect_clicked`, `container_connect_success`, `container_connect_failed`

**Toolbar**: `toolbar_feedback_clicked`, `toolbar_left_sidebar_clicked`, `toolbar_right_sidebar_clicked`, `toolbar_settings_clicked`, `toolbar_open_in_menu_clicked`, `toolbar_open_in_selected`, `toolbar_kanban_toggled`

**Browser Preview**: `browser_preview_closed`, `browser_preview_url_navigated`

**Settings**: `settings_tab_viewed`, `theme_changed`, `telemetry_toggled`, `notification_settings_changed`, `default_provider_changed`

**Agent Usage**: `agent_run_start`, `agent_run_finish`

**Aggregates**: `workspace_snapshot`, `feature_used`, `error`

</details>

#### Agent Events

**`agent_run_start`** / **`agent_run_finish`**

- `provider` - CLI provider ID (e.g., "claude", "codex")
- `outcome` - Result: `ok` or `error` (no details)
- `duration_ms` - How long the agent ran (clamped, no content)

## What We DON'T Collect

We take privacy seriously. The following data is **never** collected:

- ❌ **No code or file contents**
- ❌ **No file paths or repository names**
- ❌ **No prompts or messages sent to agents**
- ❌ **No environment variables**
- ❌ **No personally identifiable information (PII)**
- ❌ **No user text input or command contents**
- ❌ **No IP-derived location data**
- ❌ **No session recordings or screen captures**
- ❌ **No autocapture of user interactions**

### Agent Usage Privacy

When tracking agent usage, we only collect:

- Provider name (e.g., "claude-code")
- Start/finish timestamps
- Success or failure outcome
- Duration

We **do not** collect:

- Prompts or messages
- Code changes
- File paths
- Workspace names or IDs
- Any content from terminal streams

## How It Works

### Anonymous Identification

- A random **anonymous `instanceId`** is generated on first launch
- Stored locally in `${appData}/telemetry.json`
- Used as `distinct_id` for telemetry events
- Not linked to any personal information

### Data Sanitization

All telemetry data passes through a **sanitizer** that:

- Only allows explicitly allowlisted properties
- Drops any unexpected or sensitive data
- Enforces data types and formats
- Prevents accidental leakage

### Local Development

- PostHog credentials are **public and safe to commit** to the repository
- Both official builds (DMG) and developer builds (cloned repo) send telemetry by default
- Official builds use credentials injected via CI, while developer builds use credentials from `src-tauri/appConfig.json`
- Development mode is clearly marked in events via `is_dev: true` and `install_source: "dev"`

## For Developers

### Environment Variables

**For Users:**

- `TELEMETRY_ENABLED` (default: `true`) - Set to `false` to disable

**For Maintainers:**

- `INSTALL_SOURCE` - Labels distribution channel (e.g., `dmg`, `dev`)
- `POSTHOG_PROJECT_API_KEY` - Override PostHog API key (optional, defaults to public key in `src-tauri/appConfig.json`)
- `POSTHOG_HOST` - Override PostHog host (optional, defaults to public host in `src-tauri/appConfig.json`)
- PostHog credentials are public and committed to the repo in `src-tauri/appConfig.json`
- CI builds can override credentials via GitHub secrets for official releases

### Renderer Process Events

The renderer may request sending `feature_used` or `error` events via IPC:

- Constrained IPC channel handled in main process
- Only allowlisted properties are forwarded
- Everything else is dropped by the sanitizer

### Adding New Events

If you're contributing and want to add telemetry events:

1. Only track coarse, anonymous metrics
2. Add event to allowlist in telemetry service
3. Document in this file
4. Ensure no PII or sensitive data is included

## Transparency

We believe in transparency about data collection:

- This documentation is version-controlled and public
- Telemetry code is open source in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/generalaction/emdash)
- Event definitions are hardcoded (no dynamic tracking)
- You can audit exactly what is collected

## Questions?
